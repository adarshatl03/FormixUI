# 🔄 NPM Package Renaming Guide

If you need to rename `r-form-engine` on NPM, follow this step-by-step guide to ensure a smooth transition without breaking functionality for existing users.

## 📋 Checklist Before You Start

- [ ] Check if the new name is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- [ ] Decide if you want to keep the same version number or start from `1.0.0`.
- [ ] Ensure you have permissions to publish to the new name.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Update `package.json`

Change the `"name"` property to your new name.

```json
{
  "name": "your-new-package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Update Internal References

Search and replace all instances of `r-form-engine` in the codebase, especially in:

- **CLI Binary**: Update the `"bin"` section in `package.json`.
- **Imports**: Any self-referencing imports in examples or tests.
- **Documentation**: `README.md`, `USAGE_GUIDE.md`, and `CLI_GUIDE.md`.

### 3. Build & Publish the New Package

Run the build script and publish the new package.

```bash
npm run build:lib
npm publish --access public
```

### 4. Deprecate the Old Package

This is the most important step. It tells users of the old package to move to the new one.

```bash
npm deprecate r-form-engine "This package has moved to your-new-package-name. Please update your dependencies."
```

### 5. Update GitHub Repository

1. Go to your repository **Settings** on GitHub.
2. Rename the repository to match the new package name.
3. GitHub will automatically handle redirects for the repository URL.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Initialization Delay**: Once a package is unpublished or renamed, the name might be "locked" for 24 hours before someone else can use it.
- **CLI Configuration**: The `r-form.json` generated by the CLI stores the `packageName`. Existing users will need to manually update this file to the new name to continue receiving updates.
- **GitHub Pages**: You will need to update the `homepage` URL in `package.json` if your docs are hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🛡️ "Soft" Rename (Recommended)

Instead of deleting the old package, we recommend the **Deprecation** method (Step 4). This ensures that anyone currently using `r-form-engine` won't have their builds crash, but they will see a clear warning to migrate.
